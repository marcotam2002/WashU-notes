# WashU-notes

During my exchange in WashU, I've typed some of my notes from lectures and collaborated some with online resources and my understanding. This is mainly for the courses - Advanced Algorithm and Stochastic Process, as the professors don't have a typed note. Since I typed the notes quite rush, there maybe some mistakes or typos. I've typed the note mainly for my revision and probably future review. But I am also glad if this note can help anyone need it.
